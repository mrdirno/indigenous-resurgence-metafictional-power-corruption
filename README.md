## Entry Points for Contributors

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Elara, to protect a painful truth, is tempted to edit a foundational memory from the Archive, exploring the immediate, visceral consequence on her community.
- Draft the journal entry of the 19th-century missionary from the fragment, but from the perspective of the T'aałt'aa guide who led him to the cave, revealing a hidden motive.
- Create a 'memory-file' from the Archive: a single, potent sensory experience (e.g., making a tool, a moment of betrayal, a childhood game) that becomes a key piece of evidence in the modern legal battle.
- Write a dialogue between Elara and the corporate lawyer, where the lawyer argues that 'curating' history for public consumption is a moral duty, and Elara must defend chaotic, painful truth.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative UI/UX for 'The Archive' as it manifests in Elara's mind. How does she query it? How do unwanted or traumatic memories intrude? Is it a search engine, a river, a forest?
- Propose a blockchain or cryptographic story structure where each chapter is a 'block' containing both the narrative and a hidden 'ancestral memory' datum that alters the reading of previous chapters.
